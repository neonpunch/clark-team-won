***BITBOMB!***

The basis of the idea is a mechanic where you point and click to place a bomb on a flat plain. I'm just temporarily calling it BITBOMB! After a short delay, the bomb detonates in an explosion of colorful rainbow particles, destroying a perimeter of the plain, which reveals a portion of an image that's behind the plain. The image should seem like it's made of magma, dripping with lava particle effects. I had a fun idea where -- prior to any bombs being placed -- the plain has sporadic pixels of color that randomly turn on and off sporadically around the plain in a way that mimics stars glinting in a night sky. I don't know if you'd be able to do this with particle effects, but I think it'd be a fun effect when paired with a colorful bomb explosion. Another fun possible idea is, once a percentage of the plain has been destroyed, there's a massive explosion of particle effects, which reveals the rest of the image.

For my particle simulation, I want to try to make a gaseous particle. It would look somewhat similar to gas particles in Noita, with its main behavior being to float up. The particles would stop once they had nowhere to move up, like if they hit a solid ceiling.

Milo's idea of an explosion with an aftereffect of environmental destruction resonates with the possibilities of either flames, sparks, particle explosions and other effects that imbue a theme of destruction. I quite like the **Chain Reaction** concept of sowing destruction to the background. More chaotic particle movement seems fun to try.

I like Milo's and Parker's idea. A Bibomb not only has a nice name ot it but also seems like a cool idea for this assignment. I find it to be quite simple yet complex. I feel like our most difficult and critical task would be to show the damages on the plain. Furthermore, I second the idea that we make the final image a funny meme, however I know that there is a requirement of the effects that we need, so maybe instead of the meme, maybe a glitched screen that randomly changes, sometime along those lines and then maybe like Milo said after there is a certain % of the plain is destroyed, the massive explosion could change the screen from the glitched screen to a funny meme, this would incorporte all ideas.
