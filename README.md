I think Milo's idea is pretty good. It's interesting, but still very feasible without the complexity of something like the rock-paper-scissors project. I like the idea of something funny appearing in the image as you break away the particles. Stupid humor, I know, but it would be entertaining to be able to put a meme into the program and then have it gradually appear.
