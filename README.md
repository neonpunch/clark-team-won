***BITBOMB!***

The basis of the idea is a mechanic where you point and click to place a bomb on a flat plain. I'm just temporarily calling it BITBOMB! After a short delay, the bomb detonates in an explosion of colorful rainbow particles, destroying a perimeter of the plain, which reveals a portion of an image that's behind the plain. The image should seem like it's made of magma, dripping with lava particle effects. I had a fun idea where -- prior to any bombs being placed -- the plain has sporadic pixels of color that randomly turn on and off sporadically around the plain in a way that mimics stars glinting in a night sky. I don't know if you'd be able to do this with particle effects, but I think it'd be a fun effect when paired with a colorful bomb explosion. Another fun possible idea is, once a percentage of the plain has been destroyed, there's a massive explosion of particle effects, which reveals the rest of the image.

I think Milo's idea is pretty good. It's interesting, but still very feasible without the complexity of something like the rock-paper-scissors project. I like the idea of something funny appearing in the image as you break away the particles. Stupid humor, I know, but it would be entertaining to be able to put a meme into the program and then have it gradually appear.
