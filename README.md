#### Milo (hilomilo/neonpunch) was here
The basis of the idea is a mechanic where you point and click to place a bomb on a flat plain. I'm just temporarily calling it BITBOMB! After a short delay, the bomb detonates in an explosion of colorful rainbow particles, destroying a perimeter of the plain, which reveals a portion of an image that's behind the plain. The image should seem like it's made of magma, dripping with lava particle effects. I had a fun idea where -- prior to any bombs being placed -- the plain has sporadic pixels of color that randomly turn on and off sporadically around the plain in a way that mimics stars glinting in a night sky. I don't know if you'd be able to do this with particle effects, but I think it'd be a fun effect when paired with a colorful bomb explosion. Another fun possible idea is, once a percentage of the plain has been destroyed, there's a massive explosion of particle effects, which reveals the rest of the image.

#### Parker (Silicant) was here
For my particle simulation, I want to try to make a gaseous particle. It would look somewhat similar to gas particles in Noita, with its main behavior being to float up. The particles would stop once they had nowhere to move up, like if they hit a solid ceiling.

I will be maintaining the Cell class, and likely assisting with anything else that comes up in the project as the Cell class is quite simple.

#### Nevan (Nevan-Sprinxt) here
The particle simulation I imagined, flames or sparks as a result of wreckage attributed to an explosion's aftereffects. Simulate movement or activity of an objest from the particles.

Will be adding the Particle class, which will emulate for the bit bomb possible additional effects such as an ignited detonating cord like a sparkler and smoke effect. Sparkler will adopt a similar approach with a firework effect. The smoke effect will bit similar to an inverted snow fall within a small constraint on the X, y plane which can also be used to simulate flames for a residual damage effect after the bit bomb explodes. Feedback and added concepts is definitely appreciated.

#### Ishan (Ishan/ishar06) was here. 
For my particle simulation, I want to do fireworks. Basically, there will be a mechanic where you click the screen and a firework launches up the screen and then explodes with an after effect. 

I will be doing the particle graphics class and its functionality. I'm free to help out with the other classes as well.
